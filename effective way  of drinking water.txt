Water is fundamental to all aspects of life. It is essential for human health and well-being, energy and food production, healthy ecosystems, climate adaptation, gender equality and health, and more. Water is at the core of sustainable development. Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right – fundamental to everyone’s health, dignity, and prosperity. Yet, billions of people around the world lack safely managed drinking water. Demand for water is also rapidly rising due to population growth, urbanization and increasing pressures from the agriculture and energy sector. The UN 2023 Water Conference, held in New York from 22-24 March 2023, will be a key opportunity to bring world leaders together to accelerate action for water.
